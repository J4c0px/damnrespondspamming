first of all I start with using the webside like a normal human would do by enter username = test and password = test! (because it told me to)
and after that, we will see this page.

I tried the search box but nothing work .:(
but it talk about 'redirect' and first thing I thought about is network tool.

so I decided to go back and using inspect this time and using the webside like human being again.

I notice there's something appear for a few second at the name but I can't capture it because it was too fast D:

I tried again but this time I could stop the reload in time and see this id thing.

It was so suspicious so I decide to click it but it 'redirect' to the secound page and I could notice that the url change for two times.

So I copy the id and check on cyberchef.

second part of the flag? then when the url change for two times it's mean there's two part on the same link for sure.

then I click on the same link but I click the stop loading button to stop it from redirecting. (I tried so much lol)
and like I thought, another id but a diffrent code.

and put it on cyberchef.
