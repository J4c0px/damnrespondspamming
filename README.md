first of all I start with using the webside like a normal human would do by enter username = test and password = test! (because it told me to)
and after that, we will see this page.

I tried the search box but nothing work .:(
but it talk about 'redirect' and first thing I thought about is network tool.

so I decided to go back and using inspect this time and using the webside like human being again.

I notice there's something appear for a few second at the name but I can't capture it because it was too fast D:

I tried again but this time I could stop the reload in time and see this id thing.

It was so suspicious so I decide to click it but it 'redirect' to the secound page and I could notice that the url change.

So I copy the id and check on cyberchef
